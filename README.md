# The Stanford GraphBase

“The [Stanford GraphBase](http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html)
(SGB) is a collection of datasets and computer programs that generate and
examine a wide variety of graphs and networks.” It was developed and published
by [Donald E. Knuth](http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth) in 1993. The
fully documented source code is available for anonymous ftp from [Stanford
University](ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/sgb/sgb.tar.gz) and in the book “The
Stanford GraphBase, A Platform for Combinatorial Computing,” published jointly
by ACM Press and Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in 1993. (This book contains
several chapters with additional information not available in the electronic
distribution.)

## Prerequisites

The source code of SGB is written in accordance with the rules of the
[Literate Programming](http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)
paradigm, so you need to make sure that your computer supports the
[CWEB](http://www-cs-staff.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html) system. The CWEB
sources are available for anonymous ftp from [Stanford
University](ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/cweb/cweb.tar.gz). Bootstrapping CWEB
on Unix systems is elementary and documented in the CWEB distribution;
pre-compiled binary executables of the CWEB tools for Win32 systems are
available from
[www.literateprogramming.com](http://www.literateprogramming.com).

## Getting Started

Details of this software can be found in the [README](README) file.
